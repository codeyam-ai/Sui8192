          <p>
            <b>Competition Description:</b> The Sui 8192 Competition (the “Competition”) is a daily
            series of contests (each a, “contest”) that begin on Tuesday August 8, 2023 at 8:01 AM
            Pacific Time (“PT”) and ends upon our notice to the participants (the “Challenge
            Period”). The Promoter may alter the Challenge Period in its sole discretion. Please
            check the Official Rules throughout the Challenge Period for up-to-date information.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can review how the Administrator will run the Competition
            <a href="https://ethoswallet.xyz/blog/post/new-sui-8192-competition">here</a>. Please
            review the Competition Description for any updates, which are incorporated to these
            Official Rules.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Agreement to Official Rules. </b>By entering or participating in the Competition, you
            accept and agree to be bound by these “Official Rules”. Periodically during the
            Challenge Period, Promoter may announce new Competitions, in which case Promoter will
            update these Official Rules to detail the parameters of each new Competition. Please
            review the Administrator’s Terms of Service at
            <a href="https://ethoswallet.xyz/terms-of-service"
              >https://ethoswallet.xyz/terms-of-service</a
            >.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Eligibility. </b> The Competition is a skill-based contest open to legal residents of
            the 50 United States and D.C. (excluding Puerto Rico), eighteen (18) or older, as of the
            date of entry, a Sui Protocol compliant wallet, and to residents of countries where such
            contests are not prohibited. Employees, officers and directors of Administrator and
            Promoter and their parent company, affiliates, subsidiaries, are not eligible to
            participate in the Competition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <p>
          There is no limit on the number of times you may play Competition during the Challenge
          Period, subject to the terms and conditions of these Official Rules. Participating in the
          Competition using cheats, automated software (e.g., bots) or like methods of game play is
          strictly prohibited. The use of a script, macro, or any other device to automate or
          subvert the Competition is prohibited, and all such registrations and entries will be
          void. Promoter and Administrator reserves the right to permanently disqualify any person
          it believes has intentionally violated these Official Rules.
        </p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Determination of Winners. </b> Without limiting any other terms of these Official
            Rules, Promoter or Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any entrant, in its
            sole discretion, if Promoter or Administrator finds evidence or has cause to suspect
            such entrant of receiving an unfair advantage over other participants (whether by means
            of external automated software or otherwise). Score accrual will be tracked by
            Administrator’s internal clocks and systems. The decisions of the Promoter or
            Administrator (including, but not limited to, any calculation or computation by
            Administrator’s systems or the results thereof) will be final.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Prizes. </b> Rewards are administered as Sui Tokens (“Tokens”). Tokens for the
            Competition will be provided by the Promoter. Distribution of rewards will follow the
            end of each contest during the Challenge Period. Immediate or precise timing for reward
            distribution is not guaranteed. Following the end of each contest, Promoter and/or
            Administrator will endeavor to provide guidance to the participants as to the schedule
            of the reward distribution. Individual notifications as to delivery of rewards will not
            be provided.
          </p>
        </li>
        <p>
          No substitution or transfer of rewards is permitted by winner. Promoter and Administrator
          each reserves the right to substitute a reward of equal or greater value in its sole
          discretion. Promoter and Administrator will not replace any lost or stolen rewards.
          Winners are solely responsible for any and all federal, state, and local taxes, if any,
          that apply to rewards. Without limiting any other terms of these Official Rules, you agree
          to provide Promoter and Administrator with any additional information and complete any
          required tax or other forms relating to your receipt of a reward.
        </p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Notification of Winners. </b> The potential First Place Winner will be notified by
            the leaderboard (“Leaderboard”) and must respond within forty-eight (48) hours of
            initial contact to claim the reward. The potential winner may be required to sign and
            return an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release within seven (7) days
            of notification. If a selected winner of either a contest cannot be contacted, is
            ineligible, fails to claim a reward within three (3) business days and/or where
            applicable an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release is not timely
            received, is incomplete or modified, the reward may be forfeited and an alternate winner
            will be selected from remaining Leaderboard participants.
